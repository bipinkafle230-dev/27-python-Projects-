## Number Guessing Game

A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 
This project demonstrates basic Python logic, user input handling, and the use of the `random` module.

---

##  Features

- Random number generation using `random.randint()`
- Input validation for number range
- Feedback on guess accuracy (too high, too low, or correct)
- Friendly user interaction via command-line interface

---

##  Concepts Used

- `import random` for number generation
- `input()` for user interaction
- `if-elif-else` conditionals
- Basic error checking and range validation
- Formatted output using `f-strings`

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in Python.
The player competes against the computer, which randomly selects its move. 
The game tracks wins and allows the player to quit anytime.

---

##  Features

- Interactive gameplay via terminal
- Random computer moves using `random.randint()`
- Score tracking for both user and computer
- Input validation and replay loop
- Simple win/draw/loss logic

---

##  Concepts Used

- `while` loops for continuous play
- `input()` for user interaction
- `random` module for computer choice
- `if-elif-else` conditionals
- List indexing and string comparison
